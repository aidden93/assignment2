/*
	Graphical User Interface and Maze
	Author: J.R. Dermoudy & <<INSERT YOUR NAME HERE>>
	Date: September 2013

	This file corresponds to the setup() and solve()
	routines from the sample solution.  The class is
	a frame that contains the graphical user interface.
	The frame's constructor is the equivalent to setup().
	The maze is built from a textfile (maze.txt).  The
	methods depthFirst() and breadthFirst() are the
	equivalent of solve().  These are executed via a
	button click.
